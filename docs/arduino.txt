+===========================+
|Configuring the Arduino IDE|
+===========================+

  The Arduino development environment is the most commonplace IDE for
programming AVR chips, such as the ardurookie. Due to the simplicity of the
official Arduino boards, and the flexibility of the IDE, you can program
the ardurookie from within the Arduino IDE with a few slight modifications.

  The process is extremely simple. Several files need to be patched in order
for full support to be added. These patches can be found in the
extras/arduino directory. You need to locate the boards.txt file in the hardware
directory, and the Makefile in hardware/arduino/avr/bootloaders/optiboot/, then
apply the patches to those files. After restarting the IDE, the board should
appear in the "Boards" list, and the "Processor" menu will allow you to select
your clock speed.

  If you don't have the utility patch, for some reason, the contents of those
files can be pasted into their files with little difficulty.

+=============================+
|Using the Optiboot Bootloader|
+=============================+

  In addition to the IDE, the Arduino development environment includes a
bootloader for use with most AVR chips. In the modified Makefile, there are
several different bootloaders for use with the ATmega328p in the ardurookie.
No changes have been made to the bootloader, these simply provide alternate
clock speeds for the microcontroller.

!!!WARNING!!!
  If you burn a bootloader that requires an external frequency crystal, you
MUST have a crystal on the board. Without one, the microcontroller WILL NOT WORK
, necessitating the removal of the chip, or the installation of a crystal.
!!!WARNING!!!

|Using the Arduino IDE|
+=====================+

  After modifying boards.txt, and flashing the Optiboot bootloader, the
ardurookie can be programmed from the Arduino IDE by selecting the "ardurookie"
board, then changing the "Processor" to match the bootloader and fuses.
