  The first number indicates the number of versions that have been produced.
This number appears on the pcb. The second number indicates the number of major
board changes that have occurred solely on the computer, in the pcb software.
This number also appears on the pcb. The third digit is the number of times the
board has been sent to the board house for production. Since no actual board
changes occur for this revision, this number appears in very few places.

  Version 12.2.7 would indicate the 12th version of the board that has been
produced - 11 prior versions have been manufactured. Two major redesigns have
taken place on the computer since the 11.x.x series, and this is the seventh
version I've tried to send to the board house for production.

  Versions prior to 0.6 are somewhat inaccurate, as I was not keeping track
of the design/version numbers before then.

Version 0.0
  Initial layout on an arduino-sized board.

Version 0.1
  Changed to resemble arduino, but on a 1.95"x1.95" board.

Version 0.2
  Changed to throw out the arduino footprint.

Version 0.3
  Changed to make the IO pins usable with an IDE connector.

Version 0.4
  Un-rotated IC.

Version 0.5
  Rotated upper IO header to greatly simplify routing.

Version 0.6.0
  Added decoupling capacitors, optimized layout.
  "Shirley Temple" sent to production.
  
Version 0.6.1
  Changed via size for an acceptable annular ring with.
  Now 12mil drill with 35mil plating.
